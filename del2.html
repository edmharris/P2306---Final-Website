            <h2>What is Leaflet?</h2>
            <p>Leaflet is a lightweight, open-source javascript mapping library. It is fast, easy
                to use and learn, and very capable. It is also free-to-use and open source, with
                a lot of community support and 3rd-party extensions that can be used. After reviewing
                several options, it was selected as the web mapping library of choice for our project.
            </p>
            <h2>What is our process?</h2>
            <p>We used GDAL to convert a GeoTIFF to COG. For exploration purposes, we attempted it in
                both ArcGIS Pro and QGIS. We also developed a basic Leaflet application, and attempted
                to get a few different image formats to load - COG, GeoTIFF, and a regular PNG.
