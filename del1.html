            <p>By automating the production of outputs for Cambium hydrogeological group’s well water information system reports, we are elimating their reliance on 
                antiquated Microsoft Access database, which needed updating periodically, with a live link to the Ontario Ministry of the Envrionment's (MOE) web service. 
                This deliverable consisted of four parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Server connection to the MOE's Rest Endpoint (web service).</li> 
                <li>Creation of custom scripts to automate the process.</li>          
                <li>Production of report templates, in ArcGIS Pro, providing a method to output a PDF of the well data. 
                <li>Creation of supporting files, including standard operatiing procedures.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Rest endpoint is the data source provided by the MOE, and makes available the Well Water Information System database directly into ArcGIS Pro. 
                It requires an active internet connection to use, but has the benefit that unless the url changes, it does not need to be updated, and will push 
                through the Ministry’s quarterly updates without requiring any user input.</p> 
            <p>The custom scripts, designed by the Fleming Collaborative Project team 2306, automate the basic setup for accessing the endpoint, and fully automate 
                the more complex task of locating relevant data, splitting it into readable tables, and converting all units to metric as required.</p> 
            <p>The report template allows Cambium’s drafting team to produce a PDF report of the above mentioned data from within ArcGIS Pro. It takes in the table 
                data created by the custom script as fields, allows them to be positioned as required on a page, and then replicates that setup for each row of data.</p>
            <p>Supporting files include all of the original python files for the script, and for troubleshooting the script, as well as this document, which includes 
                the processes required for use, maintenance, and initial setup in case of server failure or other unforeseen circumstances.</p>
