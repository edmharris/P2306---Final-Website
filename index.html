                    <p>Our client, <a href="https://cambium-inc.com">Cambium Inc.</a>, requested two solutions as part of the project:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Streamline their internal Well Water Information System, and </li>
                        <li>Modify the processing and retrieval of aerial imagery (including internal access without enterprise-level software licensing). </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To achieve these objectives, we divided the project into two deliverables.</p>
                    <p>The first replaced Cambium&#39;s existing well water database with an ArcGIS Pro server connection to the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks publicly hosted well water feature layer.</p>
                    <p>For the second deliverable we developed a web application using Leaflet; to support the web application we also developed a process to convert images to Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF, and created a GeoJSON data store to support the retrieval of images and their associated data.</p>
                    <p>Consideration was given to ongoing maintenance and costs with the use of open-source software and pre-existing software licensing. Optimizing storage and retrieval solutions for both well water data and aerial imagery were also key considerations.</p>
