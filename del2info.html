            <h1>Deliverable 2 - Aerial Imagery Application Methodology</h1>
            <p>Cambium requested that we build a system by which their entire organization could have access to view the
                aerial imagery that they had collected for various projects. To accomplish this we developed a web
                application using Leaflet, a GeoJSON, and a conversion to Cloud Optimised GeoTIFFs (COG).</p>
            <h2>What is Leaflet?</h2>
            <p>Leaflet is a lightweight, open-source javascript mapping library. It is fast, easy
                to use and learn, and very capable. It is also free-to-use and open source, with
                a lot of community support and 3rd-party extensions that can be used. After reviewing
                several options, it was selected as the web mapping library of choice for our project.
            </p>
            <h2>What is our process?</h2>
            <p>First we created a batch script that uses GDAL to convert their existing GeoTIFFs to COGs, and
                reproject those images to EPSG 3857.
            </p>
            <p>Next we wrote a Python script to conglomerate all of the files relating to the aerial imagery
                into a GeoJSON data store. It pulls their existing shapefile of image bounds, their CSV of
                image data, and the file paths of the images themselves and combines them by photo ID.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, we used Leaflet to develop the web application,
                <a href="del2.html" target="_blank">which you can sample here.</a> It allows their non-GIS staff
                to select an area of interest, find any imagery available for that location, and then view those
                images and their associated data. For the sake of confidentiality, the app available here uses a
                sample data set that we developed for testing, using images acquired from Trent University.

            </p>
            <h2>What is GDAL?</h2>
            <p>Client aerial imagery was pre-processed from its current format (GeoTIFF) to Cloud Optimized
                GeoTIFF, for optimal storage and retrieval, using the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL).
                The commands in this library were accessed via a Windows batch file script, run within the
                OSGeo4W command shell that was bundled with an installation of QGIS (providing a command-line interface
                that includes the GDAL library). During this process the projection of the imagery was modified to EPSG 3857, to make it compatible with
                Leaflet. 
                </p>
            <h2>What is a GeoJSON?</h2>
            <p>A variant on the standard JSON (Javascript Object Notation format), GeoJSON is a data store that
                allows us to store information, including coordinate data and other properties that we define,
                and save them to a specific identifier - for our project, we used the Photo ID. That way, when
                our application needs to find information or coordinates for an image, it's simple to look up.
                It also allowed us to store the file path for each image, so that the application can find them
                without requiring any server-side scripts.
