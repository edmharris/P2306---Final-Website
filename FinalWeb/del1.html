            <h1>Deliverable 1</h1>
            <h2>Streamlining the extraction and delivery of well water data</h2>
            <p>By Automating the production of outputs for Cambium hydrogeological group’s well water information system reports, and consists of four parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Ministry of the Environment Rest Endpoint.</li> 
                <li>Custom scripts, which automate the process.</li>          
                <li>The report template, in ArcGIS Pro, providing a method to output a PDF of the well data. 
                <li>Supporting files, including this document.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Rest endpoint is the data source provided by the MOE, and makes available the Well Water Information System database directly into ArcGIS Pro. It requires an active internet connection to use, but has the benefit that unless the url changes, it does not need to be updated, and will push through the Ministry’s quarterly updates without requiring any user input. 
                The custom scripts, designed by the Fleming Collaborative Project team 2306, automate the basic setup for accessing the endpoint, and fully automate the more complex task of locating relevant data, splitting it into readable tables, and converting all units to metric as required. 
                The report template allows Cambium’s drafting team to produce a PDF report of the above mentioned data from within ArcGIS Pro. It takes in the table data created by the custom script as fields, allows them to be positioned as required on a page, and then replicates that setup for each row of data.
                Supporting files include all of the original python files for the script, and for troubleshooting the script, as well as this document, which includes the processes required for use, maintenance, and initial setup in case of server failure or other unforeseen circumstances. </p>
